# Multi-Label-Object-Detection
A project of object detection which was applied in self-driving systems to provide accurate sensing ability and calibrate object position.

# Python Source Code
* [Yolov5](https://github.com/lindcrj/Multi-Label-Object-Detection/blob/379f2e84572d99fa1d5130d76bac07a30206323d/YOLOv5.ipynb)
  * The datasets used in our project were collected by ALIN CIJOV -> [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alincijov/self-driving-cars?fbclid=IwAR3_GP8QnHIusn7NDuKsz3MAE8iV7kIas6xa4SuyGIurer5wE2RIiGxX2Nw)
  * **All classes average precision are around 0.8**
  * **Each prediction of 1 image take only 0.01s**
